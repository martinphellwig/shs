"""
The modules in this package are categorized by the name:
   Secure Hash Standard (SHS)
Which is given by the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 
(FIPS PUB) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

The author has no affiliation with the above organs and takes not credit 
beyond, translating the publication into the code. Any errors made it the 
publication will most likely be also in the implementation. The implementation 
has not been mathematically verified and as such may contain errors on its own.

Please note that most of the implementation effort went into making the 
publication as clear forward in the code as possible so that a person with
just a mathematically background can follow the implementation and a person 
with just a development background can follow the publication.
